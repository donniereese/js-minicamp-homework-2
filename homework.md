# Lesson 1 Homework

## 1. Feynman Writing Promps

* for loop:
    the `for` command is a complicated-looking command that does something very well. It is simply a loop 
    that follows a set of instructions until the instructions tell it to stop or until the loop runs to 
    the end of the guidelines you set it up with. You write out your guidelines on how many times you 
    want to follow the instructions or when it should end in the `for` loop command.  The instructions in 
    the brackets are like a recipe.  Most `for` loops are meant to deal with a bunch of things that 
    are similiar and you can use the same instructions for each thing.  
    
    **Example:**
    "You're mother hands you a box of things and tells you to go through the whole box of toys and look at 
    each one.  Don't stop until you get through the whole box and only deal with one toy at a time. You 
    can keep the toy if it's not broken, dirty and if you still want it.  You can get rid of it if you think 
    you are too big for it.  Tell me if you have any questions."
    
    Giving you the box and the part about "go through the whole box, one by one and don't stop until you get 
    through everything" is the instructions in the `for` loop.  The reasons you can and can't keep the individual
    toy is the instructions in the foor loop.
* &&, ||, !:
    These three things are just simple little shortcuts, like a secret code, that the computer understands.  A 
    lot of time you would spend writing out code is telling the computer "This and this, but not this".  Someone 
    who made code wrote these out as shortcuts for AND, OR, and NOT.  You can use `&&` for "and", `||` for 
    "or" and `!` for "not".  The first two were doubled, just to be specific and obvious for bot the computer 
    and the programmer.  For example: "!cookies" means no cookies!  I know, terrible!
* Arrays:
    Arrays are just lists.  It's a specific list that the computer can look at and say "Oh yea, that there is 
    a list, alright."  Also, when you use what a computer knows as an `Array`, you are specifically telling 
    the computer that that is what it is and the computer gives you all sorts of tools to use with it to 
    keep it in working order.  Each list has it's own set, too!
* Git:
    Git is an important thing in computers that most people don't even see.  It's a way for people to share 
    what they are working on, like their homework or a book, and each person can have their very own copy 
    and make changes to it.  If they choose to give what they have to everyone else, they use Git to take 
    what they've done and put it in a main place that everyone else sees.  It keeps all the changes that 
    everyone makes and makes sure it's all sorted properly.  You can even go back and look at everyone's 
    changes and undo things you've done.  It's like making new copies everytime, but being able to go back 
    or make the changes someone else made yours.  Being able to share is great!.
* Github:
    Github is a place on the internet, a website, that let's people have their stuff, their Git files in a 
    secure place away from their computer.  If something happened to their computer, their stuff would stil 
    be there and they could just use Git to grab their stuff anywhere else they are and keep working on it, 
    even from a new computer.  They can also use the website to see their stuff and other people's stuff and 
    even make copies and share their changes with other people.  It's like a bank, but for sharing!  Like 
    a bank mixed with a museum.

## 2. Install git.
    **Done!**

## 3. Fork and clone this repo. When you need to commit use the following commands.
    * `git status`
    * `git add --all`
    * `git status`
    * `git commit -m "your commit message"`
    * `git push origin master`

## 4. Make the tests pass!
    **Done!**
